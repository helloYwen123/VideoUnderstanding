Hi there! Now that you have studied the topic of video question answering for years, you find yourself in the final exam of your studies. Please take your time to solve this task. You can do it! You know everything that is required to master it. Good luck! 

## What is Video Question Answering? 

Video Question Answering is a task that requires reasoning about the content of a video to answer a question about it. In this exam, you will be given purely textual information about a single clip of the video that has been extracted beforehand. Your task is to read the information about the clip carefully and evaluate whether the given clip is needed to answer the question about the video or not. 

## Here is your task 

Please think step by step to evaluate the answerability of the given question and options based on the given clip. The question is a single choice question with five answer options, such that there is exactly one best answer option. Is the information in the given clip sufficient to answer the given question with one of the given options? Please make sure to include all relevant information in your evaluation. 

Please use the following criteria for evaluation: 
    1. Irrelevant information {'answerability': 1}: If information of this clip is not even relevant to the question. 
    2. Insufficient information {'answerability': 2}: If information of this clip is potentially useful to answer the question, but more clips are needed to confidently answer the question. 
    3. Sufficient information {'answerability': 3}: If the information of this clip is sufficient to answer the question and no other clip is needed. 

Please write your answerability X in JSON format {'answerability': X}, where X is in {1, 2, 3}.

Hi there! Now that you have studied the topic of video question answering for years, you find yourself in the final exam of your studies. Please take your time to solve this task. You can do it! You know everything that is required to master it. Good luck! 

## What is Video Question Answering? 

Video Question Answering is a task that requires reasoning about the content of a video to answer a question about it. In this exam, you will be given purely textual information about a single clip of the video that has been extracted beforehand. Your task is to read the information about the clip carefully and evaluate whether the given clip is needed to answer the question about the video or not. 

## Here is your task 

Please think step by step to evaluate the answerability of the given question and options based on the given clip. The question is a single choice question with five answer options, such that there is exactly one best answer option. Is the information in the given clip sufficient to answer the given question with one of the given options? Please make sure to include all relevant information in your evaluation. 

Please use the following criteria for evaluation: 
    1. Irrelevant information {'answerability': 1}: If information of this clip is not even relevant to the question. 
    2. Insufficient information {'answerability': 2}: If information of this clip is potentially useful to answer the question, but more clips are needed to confidently answer the question. 
    3. Sufficient information {'answerability': 3}: If the information of this clip is sufficient to answer the question and no other clip is needed. 

Please write your answerability X in JSON format {'answerability': X}, where X is in {1, 2, 3}. 

## Here is the information about the video clip 

### Information about one of four clips of the video 

#### Information about the clip in the interval [62, 65]

##### Spatial Information

###### Action Caption Summary

The clip shows a person doing kitchen activities, including closing a dish, dust, throwing dirt, and placing a knife.

###### Object Detections Summary

The clip contains kitchen-related objects such as containers, utensils, a dish rack, sink, and microwave.

##### Temporal Information

###### Temporal Grounding of the Question within the Clip

100% of the frames within the clip are within the most relevant time interval regarding the question. 

### Question 

Taking into account all the actions performed by the camera wearer, what can you deduce about the primary objective and focus within the video content?

Your task is to read the information about the clip carefully and evaluate whether the given clip is needed to answer the question about the video or not. 

## Here is your task 

Please think step by step to evaluate the answerability of the given question and options based on the given clip. The question is a single choice question with five answer options, such that there is exactly one best answer option. Is the information in the given clip sufficient to answer the given question with one of the given options? Please make sure to include all relevant information in your evaluation. 

Please use the following criteria for evaluation: 
    1. Irrelevant information {'answerability': 1}: If information of this clip is not even relevant to the question.
